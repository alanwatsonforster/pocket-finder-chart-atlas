# Pocket Finder-Chart Atlas

This is an atlas of finder charts for the Messier, Caldwell, and Astronomical League Urban Program objects. For each object, it gives a chart with a field of 4 degrees, flipped east-west, and showing stars to magnitude 9.5. The chart style follows the current conventions for all-sky atlases.

The code to create the atlas is in two parts. 

- The LaTex files for the individual charts are created by Python code hosted in a [Google Colab Notebook]().
