# Pocket Finder-Chart Atlas

This is an atlas of finder charts for the Messier, Caldwell, and Astronomical League Urban Program objects. For each object, it gives a chart with a field of 4 degrees, flipped east-west, and showing stars to magnitude 9.5. The chart style follows the current conventions for all-sky atlases.

The code to create the atlas is in three parts. 

- The Python code to produce the input catalogs is hosted in a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16JonQcoLPvneOuimvxtJOiUSpBR-Mixq?usp=sharing)

- The Python code to create the LaTex files for the individual charts a hosted in a [different Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VTFR25wonsBeU4-xg2RQQJk6zLVED3kO?usp=sharing).

- The LaTeX code for the book is hosted [here on GitHub](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/pocket-finder-chart-atlas).
