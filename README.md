# Pocket Finder-Chart Atlas

This is an atlas of finder charts for the Messier, Caldwell, and Astronomical League Urban Observing Program objects. 

The charts have a field of 4 degrees at a scale of 13 mm/deg, showistars to magnitude 9.5, and represent of deep-sky objects following the current convention. Circles show fields with diameters of 1, 2, 3, and 4 degrees.

If you're just interested in downloading the atlas, you will want one of these files:

- [inverted-image version](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/pocket-finder-chart-atlas/raw/main/main.pdf)
- correct-image version (not yet)

The code to create the atlas is in three parts. 

- The Python code to produce the input catalogs is hosted in a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16JonQcoLPvneOuimvxtJOiUSpBR-Mixq?usp=sharing)

- The Python code to create the LaTex files for the individual charts a hosted in a [different Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VTFR25wonsBeU4-xg2RQQJk6zLVED3kO?usp=sharing).

- The LaTeX code for the book is hosted [here on GitHub](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/pocket-finder-chart-atlas).
